# Rules:
Strive for victory by being the first player to reach a score of 50 points!
Enhance your score through dice rolls, but bewareâ€”rolling a one will reset your current session's score.
Make strategic decisions on when to hold, as it adds the current score to your overall total. Skillful play is key to triumph!
