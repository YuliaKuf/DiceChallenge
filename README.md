## Pig Game Rules:
Be the first player to reach a score of 50 points.

- **Rolling the Dice:**
  
  Players take turns rolling the dice.

  The number rolled is added to the current session's score.

- **Rolling a One:**
  
  If a player rolls a one, their current session's score is reset to zero.

  And the control passes to the other player.

- **Holding the Score:**
  
  Players can choose to "hold," which adds their current session's score to their overall total.

  The turn then passes to the other player.

- **Winning the Game:**
  
  The game continues until one player reaches a score of 50 points.

  The first player to reach or exceed 50 points is declared the winner.

- **Strategic Decision-Making:**

  Success in the game requires strategic decisions on when to hold and when to roll.

  Skilled and timely play is essential for victory.
